* Other extra features such as automatic income forwarding, automatic new token issuances, automatic broadcasts and more.
* Support for running multiple swapbot-machines
* Separate front-end "swapbot directory" system for public listings of available swapbot/vendng machines.

**Status:** In development

###BitSplit

* Token distribution and payment splitting system
* For distributions, accepts a list of addresses and amounts, adds up the total amount creates a single deposit address. User sends in total amount plus sufficient BTC for fees to the deposit address, and BitSplit handles the sending to each address provided.
* Useful for sending large group payments, or scheduled distributions (e.g LTBCOIN)
* Able to do persistant distrubutions aka "splitting"; instead of supplying a total amount, any payments (BTC or counterparty tokens) sent to the "split address" are automatically split up between each of the defined output addresses

**Status:** In development
